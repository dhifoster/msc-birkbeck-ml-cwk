# MSc Data Science - Machine Learning Coursework Project 2020

This project was part of an assessed coursework for the Machine Learning module as part of the Master of Science in Data Science degree programme at Birkbeck, University of London. The aim of this project was to implement a novel optimizer named "Weight–wise Adaptive learning rates with Moving average Estimator" (WAME) Optimizer and use it to train a Convolutional Neural Network on an optional dataset.

The optimizer was implemented in Keras and a simple CNN was built to predict the classes on the FMNIST dataset with the best overall accuracy of 88.8%.

The purpose of this upload code is to simply disserminate information and to present my implementation of this optimizer.   Please ensure to cite Mosca et al (2017) if any of the code following is used. Available from: https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/Proceedings/esann/esannpdf/es2017-50.pdf

Note: Permission from Professor George Magoulas was obtained to publish this coursework post-grading in August 2020.
